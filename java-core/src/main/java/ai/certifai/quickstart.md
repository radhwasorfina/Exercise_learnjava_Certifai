# Brief Introduction of Java

### Why use Java
### (Even though it require more lines of codes and debugging)

- Platform independent. 
    - Applications developed can work fine on all 0Ses.
- Fast performances compared to other languages
    - Java is a compiled language, the types are known during execution.  
    There's no need of step-by-step executors of source code like interpreted language, which is slower in nature.  
- Abundant ecosystems of Tools
    - Many industry software and development tools are written and developed in Java.  
- Building Android Apps is compatible.
    - Most of the android applications are written in Java using Googleâ€™s Android API. 
- Java has a strong development roadmap with continuous progress in security and performance.


### JVM - JDK - JRE

There are three keywords to familiarize with in Java Environment. 
- Java Runtime Environment (JVM)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

**Java Runtime Environment (JVM)**
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine which provides a portable execution environment for Java-based applications.  

There are two variations of Java Installation
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

**Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**
- Software bundle that allows Java Programs to run 
- Does not provide development environment. 

**Java Development Kit (JDK)**
- The full-featured SDK for Java
- **JDK includes JRE**, but also the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). Hence capable of creating and compiling programs.

Note:  
The JRE is smaller than the JDK with the lack of development tools as it require less disk spaces.

Java 8 is released on 2014

### Installation of Java :man_technologist: :woman_technologist:

Java can be installed from two sources mainly.
- [Oracle Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)

Check if Java is installed fine on your system :man_technologist: :woman_technologist:
```$xslt
java -version
```
